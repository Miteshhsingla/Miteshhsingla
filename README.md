## Hey there, I'm Mitesh

I am an engineer by degree, developer and a designer as well. 

I'm someone whoâ€™s always been interested in design and development. I believe for most of the products, both of these go hand in hand.Because of this enthusiasm towards tech & UX I have come across wide variety of technologies and projects.
