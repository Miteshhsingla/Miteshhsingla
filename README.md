#Hey there, I'm Mitesh, an engineer by degree, developer, designer and a tea lover.

I'm someone whoâ€™s always been interested in design and development. I believe for most of the products, both of these go hand in hand.Because of this enthusiasm towards tech & UX I have come across wide variety of technologies and projects.
